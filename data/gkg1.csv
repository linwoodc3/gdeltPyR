DATE,INTEGER,"This is the date in YYYYMMDD format on which the news media used to
construct this GKG file was published. NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream files, this
date represents the date of publication of the document from which the information was
extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for the
GDELT event stream. This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a
data processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an
SQL database for analysis. NOTE: for some special collections this value may be 0 indicating that
the field is either not applicable or not known for those materials. For example, OCR’d historical
document collections may not have robust metadata on publication date."
NUMARTS,INTEGER,"This is the total number of source documents containing one or more
mentions of this count. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an
count: the more discussion of that count, the more likely it is to be significant. The total
universe of source documents varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be
normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of counts during the time period of
interest."
COUNTS,INTEGER,"This is the list of Counts found in this document. Each Count found is separated with a semicolon, while
the fields within a Count are separated by the pound symbol (“#”). Unlike the primary GDELT
event stream, these records are not issued unique identifier numbers, nor are they dated. As an 
example of how to interpret this file, an entry with CountType=KILL, Number=47,
ObjectType=”jihadists” indicates that the article stated that 47 jihadists were killed. This field is
identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0 format.


    o Count Type. (text) This is the value of the NAME field from the Category List
spreadsheet indicating which category this count is of. At the time of this writing, this is
most often AFFECT, ARREST, KIDNAP, KILL, PROTEST, SEIZE, or WOUND, though other
categories may appear here as well in certain circumstances when they appear in
context with one of these categories, or as other Count categories are added over time.
A value of “PROTEST” in this field would indicate that this is a count of the number of
protesters at a protest.

    o Count. (integer) This is the actual count being reported. If CountType is “PROTEST”
and Number is 126, this means that the source article contained a mention of 126
protesters.

    o Object Type. (text) This records any identifying information as to what the number
refers to. For example, a mention of “20 Christian missionaries were arrested” will
result in “Christian missionaries” being captured here. This field will be blank in cases
where no identifying information could be identified.

    o Location Type. See the documentation for V1Locations below.

    o Location FullName. See the documentation for V1Locations below.

    o Location CountryCode. See the documentation for V1Locations below.

    o Location ADM1Code. See the documentation for V1Locations below.

    o Location Latitude. See the documentation for V1Locations below.

    o Location Longitude. See the documentation for V1Locations below.

    o Location FeatureID. See the documentation for V1Locations below."
THEMES,STRING,"This is the list of all Themes found in the nameset. For the
complete list of possible themes, see the Category List spreadsheet. At the time of this writing
there are over 150 themes currently recognized by the system."
LOCATIONS,STRING,"This is a
list of all locations found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 2
 The
algorithm is run in a more aggressive stance here than ordinary in order to extract every
possible locative referent, so may have a slightly elevated level of false positives. Note: some
locations have multiple accepted formal or informal names and this field is collapsed on name,
rather than feature (since in some applications the understanding of a geographic feature differs
based on which name was used to reference it). In cases where it is necessary to collapse by
feature, the Geo_FeatureID column should be used, rather than the Geo_Fullname column. This
is because the Geo_Fullname column captures the name of the location as expressed in the text
and thus reflects differences in transliteration, alternative spellings, and alternative names for
the same location. For example, Mecca is often spelled Makkah, while Jeddah is commonly
spelled Jiddah or Jaddah. The Geo_Fullname column will reflect each of these different
spellings, while the Geo_FeatureID column will resolve them all to the same unique GNS or GNIS
feature identification number. For more information on the GNS and GNIS identifiers, see
Leetaru (2012). 

This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the
GKG 1.0 format.Location Type. (integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type
and holds one of the following values: 1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level),
2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark),
4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE
(match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US
state). This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example,
extracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.
Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still
provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but
the FeatureID field below will contain its textual country or ADM1 code instead of a
numeric featureid.


    o Location FullName. (text) This is the full human-readable name of the matched
location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states
it is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the
format of “City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when
placing counts on a map. Note: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the
location in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location
– use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same
place.


    o Location CountryCode. (text) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the
location. Note: GDELT continues to use the FIPS10-4 codes under USG guidance while
GNS continues its formal transition to the successor Geopolitical Entities, Names, and
Codes (GENC) Standard (the US Government profile of ISO 3166).


o Location ADM1Code. (text) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by
the 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative
division housing the landmark. In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character
shortform of the state’s name (such as “TX” for Texas). Note: see the notice above for
CountryCode regarding the FIPS10-4 / GENC transition. Note: to obtain ADM2 (districtlevel)
assignments for locations, you can either perform a spatial join against a ShapeFile
template in any GIS software, or cross-walk the FeatureID to the GNIS/GNS databases –
this will provide additional fields such as ADM2 codes and MGRS grid references for
GNS.


    o Location Latitude. (floating point number) This is the centroid latitude of the landmark
for mapping. In the case of a country or administrative division this will reflect the
centroid of that entire country/division.


    o Location Longitude. (floating point number) This is the centroid longitude of the
landmark for mapping. In the case of a country or administrative division this will reflect
the centroid of that entire country/division.


    o Location FeatureID. (text OR signed integer) This is the numeric GNS or GNIS FeatureID
for this location OR a textual country or ADM1 code. More information on these values
can be found in Leetaru (2012).4 Note: This field will be blank or contain a textual ADM1
code for country or ADM1-level matches – see above. Note: For numeric GNS or GNIS
FeatureIDs, this field can contain both positive and negative numbers, see Leetaru
(2012) for more information on this."
PERSONS,STRING,"This is the list of all person names found in the text,
extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 5
 This name recognition algorithm is unique in
that it is specially designed to recognize the African, Asian, and Middle Eastern names that yield
significantly reduced accuracy with most name recognition engines. This field is identical in
format and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0 format."
ORGANIZATIONS,STRING,"This is the list of all company and organization
names found in the text, extracted through the Leetaru (2012) algorithm. 6
 This is a
combination of corporations, IGOs, NGOs, and any other local organizations such as a local fair
or council. This engine is highly adaptive and is currently tuned to err on the side of inclusion
when it is less confident about a match to ensure maximal recall of smaller organizations around
the world that are of especial interest to many users of the GKG. Conversely, certain smaller
companies with names and contexts that do not provide a sufficient recognition latch may be
missed or occasionally misclassified as a person name depending on context. It is highly
recommended that users of the Persons and Organizations fields histogram the results and
discard names appearing just once or twice to eliminate most of these false positive matches.
This field is identical in format and population as the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0 format."
TONE,INTEGER,"This field contains a comma-delimited
list of six core emotional dimensions, described in more detail below. Each is recorded as a
single precision floating point number. This field is nearly identical in format and population as
the corresponding field in the GKG 1.0 format with the sole exception of adding the single new
WordCount variable at the end.


    o Tone. (floating point number) This is the average “tone” of the document as a whole.
The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive). Common
values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral. This is calculated as
Positive Score minus Negative Score. Note that both Positive Score and Negative Score
are available separately below as well. A document with a Tone score close to zero may
either have low emotional response or may have a Positive Score and Negative Score
that are roughly equivalent to each other, such that they nullify each other. These
situations can be detected either through looking directly at the Positive Score and
Negative Score variables or through the Polarity variable.


    o Positive Score. (floating point number) This is the percentage of all words in the article
that were found to have a positive emotional connotation. Ranges from 0 to +100.


    o Negative Score. (floating point number) This is the percentage of all words in the
article that were found to have a positive emotional connotation. Ranges from 0 to
+100.


    o Polarity. (floating point number) This is the percentage of words that had matches in
the tonal dictionary as an indicator of how emotionally polarized or charged the text is.
If Polarity is high, but Tone is neutral, this suggests the text was highly emotionally
charged, but had roughly equivalent numbers of positively and negatively charged
emotional words.


    o Activity Reference Density. (floating point number) This is the percentage of words
that were active words offering a very basic proxy of the overall “activeness” of the text
compared with a clinically descriptive text.


    o Self/Group Reference Density. (floating point number) This is the percentage of all
words in the article that are pronouns, capturing a combination of self-references and group-based discourse. News media material tends to have very low densities of such
language, but this can be used to distinguish certain classes of news media and certain
contexts.


    o Word Count. (integer) This is the total number of words in the document. This field
has just been added to the format and will be blank or 0 for most documents until it is
fully integrated into the GKG system"
CAMEOEVENTIDS,INTEGER,"This field contains a comma-separated list of GlobalEventIDs
from the master GDELT event stream of events that were found in the same article(s) as this
count was found. This can be used, for example, to associate any protest events from the
primary GDELT event database with any “PROTEST” counts found in the same articles to compile
a basic measure of how many protesters were involved with the protest. This is useful in that
the GDELT event record for the protest encodes many other variables, such as the specific actors
involved and their attributes, while the Count record only records that a certain number of
protesters were mentioned in an article. The same GlobalEventID may appear in multiple
entries if multiple counts were found in the same article mentioning that event or if that event
was mentioned in multiple news articles with different counts (reflecting conflicting or evolving
information on the details of the event)."
SOURCES,STRING,"This is a semicolon-delimited list of all of the sources publishing articles mentioning
this nameset. For web-based news material, this is the top-level domain the page was from,
while for BBC Monitoring service material, “BBC Monitoring” will appear. Thus, it is important
to note that this field will contain a mixture of domain names and the phrase “BBC Monitoring”."
SOURCEURLS,STRING,"This is a delimited list of ALL articles mentioning this nameset. Since URLs can
contain a wide variety of characters the phrase “<UDIV>” is used as the delimiter between
articles. For web-based news material, this will be the complete URL to the article, while for
BBC Monitoring service material, “BBC Monitoring” will appear. Thus, it is important to note
that this field will contain a mixture of URLs and the phrase “BBC Monitoring”. It is also
important to note that this field contains a list of ALL source articles, unlike the primary GDELT
event stream, which only lists the first source article mentioning an event in the case an event is
mentioned in multiple articles."
