It will be blank for documents originally in English.  At this time the field will also be blank for documents translated by a human translator and provided to GDELT in English (such as BBC Monitoring materials) \u2013 in future this field may be expanded to include information on human translation pipelines, but at present it only captures information on machine translated materials.  An example of the contents of this field might be \u201csrclc:fra; eng:Moses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0\u201d.  NOTE:  Machine translation is often not as accurate as human translation and users requiring the highest possible confidence levels may wish to exclude events whose only mentions are in translated reports, while those needing the highest-possible coverage of the non-Western world will find that these events often offer the earliest glimmers of breaking events or smaller-bore events of less interest to Western media.  \no\tSRCLC.

This is a textual citation string that indicates the engine(s) and model(s) used to translate the text.  The format of this field will vary across engines and over time and no expectations should be made on the ordering or formatting of this field.  In the example above, the string \u201cMoses 2.1.1 / MosesCore Europarl fr-en / GT-FRA 1.0\u201d indicates that the document was translated using version 2.1.1 of the Moses   SMT platform, using the \u201cMosesCore Europarl fr-en\u201d translation and language models, with the final translation enhanced via GDELT Translingual\u2019s own version 1.0 French translation and language models.  A value of \u201cGT-ARA 1.0\u201d indicates that GDELT Translingual\u2019s version 1.0 Arabic translation and language models were the sole resources used for translation.  Additional language systems used in the translation pipeline such as word segmentation systems are also captured in this field such that a value of \u201cGT-ZHO 1.0 / Stanford PKU\u201d indicates that the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter   was used to segment the text into individual words and sentences, which were then translated by GDELT Translingual\u2019s own version 1.0 Chinese (Traditional or Simplified) translation and language models.",
